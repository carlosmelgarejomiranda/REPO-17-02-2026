<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to build Avenue, a platform connecting brands and content creators, which also includes a physical studio rental service and an e-commerce platform.

In this session, the user's requests covered a wide range of tasks, from completing core features to extensive refactoring and new strategic initiatives:
1.  **FEATURE:** Complete the application cancellation feature for both admins and creators.
2.  **BUG:** Fix email notifications, which were not being sent due to incorrect sender configuration in the  file.
3.  **FEATURE/REFACTOR:** Conduct a full audit of the email notification system. The user provided a comprehensive list of all events that should trigger an email for each user type (UGC Brand, UGC Creator, Studio Client, etc.) and requested the implementation of all missing notifications and the correction of all sender addresses.
4.  **BUG:** A brand campaign report was showing hardcoded demo data for demographics charts even when no real data existed.
5.  **BUG:** A UI issue where form select fields had a light background in dark mode, making them unreadable.
6.  **BUG:** The campaign transfer tool was showing a generic connection error message.
7.  **FEATURE:** Improve the metrics report table by adding a visual indicator for the social media platform (TikTok/Instagram) and a direct link to the post URL.
8.  **FEATURE:** Unify the UI by adding the official site navbar to all pages within the creator and brand dashboards.
9.  **FEATURE/UX:** Redesign the mobile view of the creator dashboard to be more compact and feel like a native app.
10. **FEATURE (Strategic):** Create a private, admin-only page to serve as an investor presentation/pitch deck, outlining Avenue's business model, traction, and vision.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB platform. The core UGC (User-Generated Content) flow is functional, allowing brands to create campaigns and creators to apply, submit content, and report metrics. Key systems in place include:
-   **Full Cancellation Flow:** Admins and creators can now cancel confirmed campaign applications. This triggers slot adjustments and sends email notifications to all relevant parties.
-   **Refactored Email System:** The email notification system has been thoroughly audited and updated. Specific sender emails (, , , etc.) are now correctly configured and used for different events across the UGC, Studio, and E-commerce modules. The Resend domain is verified, allowing the use of these custom sender addresses.
-   **Data-Driven Reports:** The bug causing demo data in brand reports has been fixed. The backend now aggregates real demographic data from creator-submitted metrics and returns  if none are available. The frontend correctly displays a No data message in this scenario.
-   **Unified UGC UI:** A new reusable  component has been created and implemented across all brand and creator dashboard pages, providing consistent navigation.
-   **Mobile-Optimized Creator Dashboard:** The creator dashboard has been completely redesigned with a mobile-first approach, featuring a bottom navigation bar, a compact stats grid, and quick-action buttons for a native app-like feel.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was gathering information and clarifying the complete business model for Avenue in order to create a private investor presentation page. This involved the user providing detailed context about the business's origins as a physical showroom, its current services (UGC platform, e-commerce, studio rental), and its strategic vision. The agent's last action was to review the existing frontend pages to find more information as requested by the user.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** This is a content generation and new page creation task. The initial steps do not require testing. Once the page is created, a screenshot will be sufficient for visual verification.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Transfer Campaign Error Diagnosis (Priority: P0)
-   Issue 2: Fix Dark Mode UI for Forms (Priority: P1)

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1: Transfer Campaign Error Diagnosis**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent confirmed via  that the backend endpoint for transferring campaigns is working correctly. The investigation revealed the frontend error occurs when the user attempts to transfer a campaign to an email address that is not associated with a registered UGC Brand Profile. The user confirmed this was the cause.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** The issue is resolved from a technical standpoint. A potential UX improvement would be to provide a more descriptive error message on the frontend, such as Error: El email de destino no corresponde a una marca registrada en la plataforma UGC. This would require updating the error handling in .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To improve user experience and prevent confusion for the admin.
    -   **Status:** RESOLVED (User confirmed the cause), UX Improvement is NOT STARTED.
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2: Fix Dark Mode UI for Forms**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent applied  and  to select and input fields in .
    -   **Next debug checklist:** While the agent applied fixes and confirmed them via code review, the user has not confirmed the visual fix for the unreadable text in dropdowns. The fix should be verified via screenshot or user confirmation. The same styles should be audited and applied to all other forms in the application (e.g., Creator Onboarding) to ensure consistency.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Ensures basic usability and a consistent dark-mode experience across all forms.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Create Private Investor Page (Priority: P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has a solid understanding of the business model. The next step is to propose a concise structure for the investor page (as requested by the user) and, upon approval, proceed to create a new, privately routed React component for this presentation.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A key strategic asset for the user to attract investment, accessible securely from the admin panel.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (visual verification via screenshot).
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

    -   **For Creators:** When they level up in the ranking system.
    -   **For E-commerce:** Full order confirmation and status change (confirmed, shipped, delivered) email flow.

-   **Mobile-First is the New Standard:** The user has explicitly requested an app-like feel for mobile. All new frontend development, especially for the creator and brand panels, should follow the mobile-first pattern established in .
-   **Email System Structure:** The email system has been centralized.  handles UGC notifications, while  handles Studio and E-commerce. Sender addresses are configured in  and the  file. Follow this pattern for any new notifications.
-   **Error Messages:** When fixing bugs like the campaign transfer error, consider improving the user-facing error message on the frontend to be more descriptive than a generic connection error.
