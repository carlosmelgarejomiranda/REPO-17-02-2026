<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goals were to fix a critical Body is disturbed or locked JavaScript error blocking creator applications, and to address significant UX confusion in the creator-facing dashboard. Throughout the session, the scope expanded to include:
1.  **BUG (CRITICAL):** Fixing the Body is disturbed or locked error affecting campaign applications, especially on Safari/iOS.
2.  **FEATURE (MAJOR):** A complete redesign of the creator dashboard navigation to eliminate confusion between Campaigns and Search Campaigns, consolidating workflows into a new My Work section.
3.  **BUG (HIGH):** Fixing the admin panel's creator list, which only showed the last 50 creators and displayed an incorrect total count. This was evolved into implementing a Load More pagination system to handle thousands of users.
4.  **UX/UI FIX:** Improving the layout and readability of the campaign description in the application modal, which was displayed as an unformatted block of text.
5.  **FEATURE (AI):** Improving the AI-powered metric extraction from TikTok screenshots to correctly identify Espectadores (Viewers) as Alcance (Reach) and making the extracted data visible on the success screen for verification.
6.  **FEATURE (UX/UI):** Applying a consistent color scheme (first gold, then corrected to pink/purple) across the entire creator panel to align with the brand's aesthetic.
7.  **FEATURE (UI):** Updating the public pricing page () with new plans, reordering sections, and adding dynamic styling including a lava lamp animation effect for premium plans.
8.  **FEATURE (UI):** A final request to apply similar dynamic styling (lava lamp effects) to the UGC brand pricing page ().
