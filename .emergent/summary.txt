<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to build Avenue, a SaaS platform connecting brands with UGC creators, including an e-commerce store and studio rental. The project evolved, introducing AI-powered metric extraction from social media screenshots.

Recently, the user initiated a major strategic pivot. Avenue is no longer just a multi-brand store but has been repositioned as a **positioning and visibility agency** with a commercial platform (e-commerce + physical showroom) as its key differentiator. This has made **Avenue Studio** (offering studio rental, a UGC platform, and content production services) the core of the business.

This strategic shift prompted a complete overhaul of all public-facing landing pages to reflect the new messaging and business structure. The previous top priority, a Unified Account with Progressive Profiles, was partially implemented before being paused in favor of the rebranding effort.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Latest):**
-   **Strategic Repositioning:** All public-facing web pages (, , , etc.) must reflect the new identity as a positioning and visibility agency.
-   **Clear Service Offerings:** The site must clearly delineate the three main pillars: E-commerce (Avenue Online), Avenue Studio, and the service for brands to feature their products (Tu marca en Avenue).
-   **Conversion-Focused Pages:** The informational pages, especially for the UGC service, must prominently feature clear, accurate pricing plans designed to convert visitors into customers.
-   **Authentic Messaging:** Avoid invented statistics or features. The value proposition for pricing plans should be based on real platform features and economies of scale (i.e., lower cost per deliverable on higher volume plans).
-   **Unified Account System:** (Currently on hold) A single, simple registration with progressive disclosure for Creator, Brand, and E-commerce profiles.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB platform.
- **Core UGC & AI:** A robust, admin-centric campaign management system is in place, including an AI-powered service (using Gemini Vision) to extract performance metrics from screenshots.
- **Redesigned Public Pages:** The main landing page (), the Studio page (), and the UGC-related pages (, , ) have been completely rewritten to align with the new company strategy.
- **UGC for Brands Page:** This page () now features a conversion-focused design with a clear hero message, prominent pricing plans that highlight the decreasing cost-per-material, and a list of platform features included in every plan. The backend models and API for packages have been updated to reflect this.
- **Partially Unified UX:**
    - The e-commerce checkout flow now offers an automated 10% discount for new users who log in/register. This feature was fully implemented and tested.
    - The brand onboarding flow () was refactored to use the single, unified authentication modal.
- **Routing Fix:** A bug causing  to show a blank page has been resolved.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was redesigning the  page to make the pricing plans more attractive and transparent.

This involved updating both the frontend component () and the backend package definitions ().

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **MAJOR STRATEGIC PIVOT:** The business has been redefined as a positioning and visibility agency. This context is crucial. The previous goal of being a multi-brand store is outdated. All public-facing work must align with this new strategy.
-   **USER IS DESIGN-FOCUSED:** The user has a strong vision for the UI/UX and provides detailed, iterative feedback on messaging, layout, and imagery. Be prepared to work closely with them on visual details.
-   **AUTHENTICITY IS KEY:** Do not invent features or statistics for marketing copy. The user has explicitly rejected this. The value proposition for plans must be based on real, existing platform features and economies of scale (lower cost-per-material).
-   **CURRENT PRIORITY:** The user's focus is on perfecting the public-facing landing pages. Do not resume work on the Unified Account tasks until the user gives explicit approval and confirms they are satisfied with the redesigns.
