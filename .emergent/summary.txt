<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a high-end, editorial-style landing page for Avenue, a multi-brand store. The project's scope has since expanded significantly to include:
1.  A full-stack booking system for a photography studio.
2.  A multi-campaign UGC (User-Generated Content) platform with an admin management panel.
3.  A complete, full-featured e-commerce platform called Avenue Online.
4.  A product image management system within the admin dashboard.
5.  An AI-powered tool to generate social media marketing assets (flyers).
6.  A complete redesign of the e-commerce section to mimic the aesthetic of Fear of God, including a complex, multi-column mega-menu.
7.  A full-site redesign of all remaining pages to match a new, dynamic, editorial aesthetic inspired by Peerspace.com.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Booking System**: A fully functional reservation system for the photo studio.
-   **UGC Creator Platform**: A platform for creators to apply for campaigns, with an admin dashboard to manage applications.
-   **E-commerce Platform (Avenue Online)**: A complete online store with product sync from an ERP, highly advanced variant grouping, a product detail modal, cart, and a complete checkout flow. It must have a Fear of God inspired aesthetic.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A private section () to manage reservations, UGC applications, e-commerce orders, product images, and download product reports.
-   **Marketing Asset Generation**: Ability to generate marketing materials (e.g., Instagram flyers) using AI.
-   **High-End Aesthetics**: The entire site must adhere to a sophisticated, minimalist, and dynamic design language inspired by Fear of God (for e-commerce) and Peerspace (for the rest of the site).
-   **Performance**: The e-commerce site must load quickly, despite a slow external ERP API.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
-   **Frontend**: The e-commerce section (, , etc.) has been completely restyled with a minimalist Fear of God aesthetic. It features a highly complex, single unified navigation bar with a multi-column Brands mega-menu and a separate hamburger menu for site navigation, both with fixes for hover persistence. The Avenue Studio pages (, , ) and the main landing page () have been completely redesigned with a dynamic, editorial Peerspace aesthetic, featuring large imagery, animations, and modern layouts. A new reusable  component has been created and implemented on cart, checkout, and order success pages.
-   **Backend**: The  module is highly robust, featuring complex brand unification logic in the  endpoint to handle various naming inconsistencies from the ERP (e.g., grouping multiple brands under AVENUE OUTLET, unifying BODYCULPT and BODY SCULPT).
-   **AI Features & Integrations**: Remain as they were, with Gemini for flyer generation and integrations for Twilio, Stripe, Google Maps, and Resend.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user requested that the new, dynamic Peerspace editorial aesthetic be applied to all remaining pages that have the old design. The agent identified the target pages and began the process, starting with  and then moving on to  and .
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N (The overall task is not complete).
- Which testing method agent to use? Screenshot tool to verify the new design on each updated page. After all pages are redesigned, the frontend testing agent should be used to run a full regression test and ensure no functionality was broken.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no active bugs. The work is focused on a feature enhancement (site-wide redesign).

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Apply Editorial Redesign to All Remaining Pages (Priority: P0)

 **Task Detail:**
  - **Task 1: Apply Editorial Redesign to All Remaining Pages**
     - **Where to resume:** The agent has successfully redesigned , ,  (rental page), and . The next step is to apply the same editorial aesthetic to the remaining pages, specifically:
        1.  (/studio/reservar) - The studio booking/calendar interface.
        2.  - The form for creators to apply to campaigns.
        3.  - The global site footer.
        4. Any other minor components that still have the old design.
     - **What will be achieved with this?** A visually consistent, high-end, and modern user experience across the entire website, fulfilling the user's request for a full aesthetic upgrade.
     - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
     - **Blocked on something:** Nothing.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P1: Clarify Email Notification Strategy**: Awaiting user confirmation on whether to use  or migrate to  for production order notifications.
    - **P2: Implement Bancard Payment Gateway**: Blocked. Awaiting API credentials from the user.
    - **P3: Full Site Translation Audit**: A full audit of all components is required to find and translate any remaining untranslated text.

    Future Tasks:
    - **Add Full Language Content**: Add complete translations for Portuguese, German, and French.
    - **Domain & Analytics Finalization**: Post-deployment, assist the user with connecting their custom domain and setting up Google Analytics.

**Completed work in this session**
- **E-commerce Bug Fixes & Enhancements**:
  - Fixed the critical brand filter not working bug.
  - Implemented complex brand unification logic on the backend per user specifications (e.g., AVENUE OUTLET, BODY SCULPT, UNDISTURBED, SUN68).
  - Ensured the sum of products in filtered categories matches the total number of products.
  - Added the product's original brand name to all product cards sitewide.
- **E-commerce Header Redesign**:
  - Removed the double navigation bar (black and white) and created a single, unified white header.
  - Reorganized the header layout multiple times based on user feedback to its final structure (Brands left; cart, hamburger menu, login, language right; search bar below).
  - Fixed persistent hover issues where the Brands mega-menu and the new hamburger menu would close prematurely. The final solution uses  and .
  - Vertically centered all items in the new navigation bar.
- **Full Site Aesthetic Overhaul (In Progress)**:
  - Completely redesigned  with a dynamic, editorial Peerspace aesthetic.
  - Applied the same new aesthetic to  (studio rental page) and  (UGC campaigns page).
  - Redesigned  to match the new editorial style.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Bancard Integration Blocked**: Awaiting API credentials from the user.
   - **Email Confirmation Limitation**: The path forward (Resend vs. Gmail) is pending user clarification.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS. Advanced state management in  using , , and  with  to create robust hover-activated menus that don't close prematurely. Heavy use of relative/absolute positioning and group-hover states.
- **Backend**: FastAPI. Advanced use of Python's  module and list comprehensions to create a flexible and powerful brand filtering and unification system in .

**key DB schema**
  - No changes in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- : **CRITICAL FILE**. The heart of the e-commerce experience. Contains the final, complex unified header, two separate hover-menu systems, the search bar, and product grid logic. All hover issues were resolved here.
- : The backend logic for brand unification and filtering resides here. Crucial for understanding how brand names are processed.
- : The showcase for the new Peerspace editorial design.
- , : Further examples of the new design system.
- : The most recently redesigned page.
- : Contains the top-level routing logic, showing how the new header structure is applied across shop pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: This component's complexity has grown significantly. It now manages the state and layout for the page, the product grid, the search bar, the Brands mega-menu, and the hamburger navigation menu. The hover logic, which uses timeouts, could be extracted into a reusable custom hook (e.g., ) to simplify the component.

**key api endpoints**
- : The primary endpoint for fetching products. It was enhanced to accept a  parameter which now triggers complex server-side unification logic.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Continue the site-wide redesign task. The user wants the new Peerspace editorial aesthetic applied to all remaining pages. Your next targets are  (/studio/reservar) and  (the application form).
- **AESTHETICS ARE CRITICAL**: The user is highly focused on achieving a specific, high-end editorial look. Pay close attention to visual details like alignment, spacing, typography, and animations. Use the newly redesigned pages (, ) as your primary reference.
- **HOVER MENU LOGIC**: The hover menus in  were difficult to get right. They now use  and  to prevent them from closing when the user moves the cursor between the trigger and the dropdown. Be cautious if you need to modify this implementation.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : Updated multiple times to reflect successful testing of the brand filter fix and the subsequent brand unification feature.
