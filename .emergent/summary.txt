<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a high-end, editorial-style landing page for Avenue, a multi-brand store. The scope expanded significantly to include:
1.  **Avenue Studio Page**: A separate page for renting a photography studio.
2.  **Full Booking System**: An integrated system for the studio page allowing users to book time slots. This includes user authentication (email/password and Google OAuth), an admin dashboard to manage reservations, and email confirmations.
3.  **Site Architecture Refactor**: The main landing page was restructured to be a gateway, directing users to either Join Avenue (for brands) or Avenue Studio.
4.  **UGC Creator Platform**: A new section under Avenue Studio for managing user-generated content campaigns. This platform supports multiple, distinct campaigns (e.g., for AVENUE, for SANTAL), each with its own requirements and a detailed application form with complex validation logic.
5.  **Terms and Conditions**: A dedicated page for legal terms, to be linked from the UGC campaign forms.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Booking System**:
    - Users can reserve studio time based on available slots (9 AM - 10 PM daily).
    - Admins can manually create/manage bookings via a dashboard.
    - Users can register/login with email or Google.
    - An admin account is pre-defined ().
    - Booking confirmations are sent via email.
    - Payment is handled offline.
    - Users cannot book for the same day (must be done via WhatsApp).
- **UGC Creator Platform**:
    - Display multiple, distinct campaigns with unique requirements.
    - A detailed application form with fields for personal data, social media links, follower counts, and content samples.
    - Complex client-side and server-side validation (age > 18, public profiles, min follower count).
    - Store applications in a database with a status (, , etc.).
    - Include a page for Terms and Conditions linked from the application form.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was tasked with adding a dedicated Terms and Conditions page and integrating it into the UGC campaign application form. This involved creating the new page/component, adding the route, and updating the form's checkboxes to link to the new page and reflect the legal text provided by the user.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: The UGC form's checkboxes have not been updated with the final legal text and the link to the new Terms and Conditions page. (Priority: P0)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent successfully created the  component and added the  route. It viewed the  file to prepare for the final edit but did not complete the  operation to update the checkboxes.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Edit .
        2. Locate the checkbox section near the end of the form.
        3. Replace the existing checkboxes with the new structure provided by the user, which includes a  component from  pointing to .
        4. Ensure the new checkbox logic is correctly wired to the form's state.
        5. Verify the changes using the screenshot tool on a campaign page (e.g., ).
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a legal requirement for the UGC platform and a direct user request to finalize the application form.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: In , implement the final  to update the checkbox section.
     - What will be achieved with this? The UGC application form will be functionally complete, including the required legal consent mechanism.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P0: Implement Gmail SMTP for Email Confirmation**: The current Resend integration only allows sending emails to the user's registered email address, which is a blocker for production. The user has agreed to switch to Gmail SMTP but postponed providing the necessary App Password. The agent needs to guide the user to generate this password and then refactor the backend email service.
    - **P1: Admin Panel for UGC Applications**: The backend collects UGC applications, but the admin has no way to view or manage them. The  dashboard needs to be extended with a new section to list, filter, and update the status of these applications.

    Future Tasks:
    - **Add Language Translations**: The i18n framework is in place, but only Spanish content exists. Add translations for English, Portuguese, German, and French to .
    - **Domain & Analytics Finalization**: Assist the user with the steps outlined in  to connect their custom domain and finalize Google Analytics setup.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Avenue Studio Page Enhancements**: Implemented a dark theme, added editorial background images, and styled the navigation bar with a dark background and gold accents.
- **Booking System**: Implemented a complete, full-stack reservation system with user authentication (email/password & Google OAuth), a calendar UI, booking logic, and an admin dashboard for management.
- **Booking Restrictions**: Added logic to prevent users from booking on the current day, directing them to WhatsApp instead.
- **Email Confirmation**: Integrated  for sending booking confirmation emails, including a test-email button in the admin panel.
- **Site Architecture Refactor**: Restructured the entire site, creating new landing pages (, ) to guide user flow.
- **UGC Creator Platform**: Built a dynamic, multi-campaign platform with a detailed application form and complex validation rules.
- **Backend Development**: Created FastAPI models and endpoints for users, reservations, and UGC applications, storing data in MongoDB.
- **Terms & Conditions Page**: Created the component and route for the T&C page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: **Email Confirmation Limitation**
     - Debug checklist: The agent discovered that Resend's free tier only allows sending emails to the registered account holder, not to the customers making bookings. The agent proposed using Gmail SMTP as a free and effective alternative.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? This is critical for the booking system to be functional, as customers will not receive confirmation emails.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Backend
     - Is recurring issue? N
   - Issue 2: **body stream already read error**
     - Debug checklist: User reported this frontend error during login/registration. The agent correctly identified that the  was being read before checking . A fix was implemented to first check the response status and then conditionally parse the JSON, along with showing a more user-friendly error message if the email is already registered.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? Provides better error handling and user experience during authentication.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend
     - Is recurring issue? Y (It's a common frontend error pattern)

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, 
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (email/password), Google OAuth (via Emergent-managed integration)
- **Integrations**: Resend (for email), Google Maps
- **State Management**: React Hooks (, , )

**key DB schema**
  - **users**: 
  - **reservations**: 
  - **ugc_applications**: 

**changes in tech stack**
  - **Backend**: Added  and  to .
  - **Frontend**: No new libraries were added, but the project structure was significantly altered.

**All files of reference**
- : Heavily modified to handle new routing, authentication context, and multi-page layouts.
- : Heavily modified with new Pydantic models and endpoints for auth, reservations, and UGC applications.
- : New, large component for the UGC application form.
- : New component for the reservation system UI.
- : New component for login/registration modals.
- : New component for the admin panel.
- : New data file defining the UGC campaigns.
- : New component for the T&C page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: This file has grown very large and handles routing, auth state, modal state, and multiple layouts. It could be broken down into smaller, more focused components (e.g., a dedicated router component, layout components).
- ****: This component is over 600 lines long and contains complex state management and validation logic. It could be split into smaller sub-components for each section of the form.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Admin Credentials**: The admin account exists. Use  and  to log in and access the  panel.
- **Email Limitation**: The email confirmation feature is NOT production-ready. It uses Resend, which can only send emails to the developer's registered email (). The user has postponed the migration to Gmail SMTP. Do not attempt to test email delivery to other addresses until this is fixed.
- **Browser Cache**: The user frequently experiences issues seeing updates due to browser cache on their mobile device. Always remind the user to perform a hard refresh or use an incognito window after deploying changes.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
  - 
  - Test reports from the backend testing agent confirming the reservation API works.
