<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a high-end, editorial-style landing page for Avenue, a multi-brand store. The project's scope has since expanded to include a full-stack booking system for a photography studio, a multi-campaign UGC (User-Generated Content) platform, an admin dashboard, and user authentication. Throughout the process, the user has provided extensive, iterative feedback to refine the site's aesthetics, requesting a sophisticated, compact, and elegant design with specific color palettes (black, nude, gold), background imagery, and component styling. The latest requests focus on finalizing the administrative backend, including managing UGC applications and setting up notifications, before deployment.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Booking System**: A fully functional reservation system for the photo studio.
- **UGC Creator Platform**: A platform for creators to apply for content campaigns, with a detailed form.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A private section for admins () to manage reservations and UGC applications.
- **Notifications**: The admin must receive a notification (Email/WhatsApp) for every new studio booking and every new UGC application.
- **High-End Aesthetics**: The entire site must adhere to a sophisticated and elegant design language, with a consistent theme across all pages.
- **Deployment**: The user intends to deploy the final application to their custom domain .

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
-   **Frontend**: A multi-page website featuring a main landing page (), a page for brands (), a page for the photography studio (), a complete booking system (), a UGC application platform (), a Terms & Conditions page, and an admin dashboard (). The UI has been heavily customized with a dark/nude theme, architectural background images, and specific component styling as per user feedback.
-   **Backend**: Endpoints for user authentication (email/password & Google), full CRUD for reservations, and API endpoints for submitting and managing UGC applications stored in MongoDB.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The user requested to see how data from a UGC application would look in the admin panel. This interrupted the agent's ongoing task of building out the UGC management section in the admin dashboard and implementing a notification system for new bookings and UGC applications. The agent was about to generate a test UGC application via a  command.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? both. First, use  to create the test data as requested. Then, use the frontend screenshot tool to verify the new UGC section in the admin dashboard at , and a backend testing script or  to test the new notification logic once implemented in .
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: The Admin Dashboard for UGC is incomplete, and the notification system is not implemented. (Priority: P0)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has modified  to add the UI structure for a UGC tab. The work on the backend () to add notification logic has not yet started.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. **Fulfill immediate user request**: Use  to POST a test application to the  endpoint to populate the database.
        2. **Backend**: Modify . Implement a helper function to send WhatsApp/email notifications. Integrate this function into the reservation creation and UGC application submission endpoints.
        3. **Frontend**: In , complete the  hook to fetch data from the  endpoint.
        4. Render the fetched UGC applications within the Campañas UGC tab, including details and status.
        5. Add buttons/controls to the UI to update the status or delete applications, connecting them to the respective  and  API endpoints.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical pre-deployment requirement from the user to manage content campaigns and be alerted to new business activities.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete Admin Dashboard and Notification System (Priority: P0)
  
 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: Start by creating a test UGC application using . Then, proceed to implement the backend notification logic in  and finish connecting the frontend  to the backend APIs.
     - What will be achieved with this? Admins will have a functional interface to view and manage all UGC applications and will receive real-time notifications for new bookings and applications.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
     - Blocked on something: The agent needs to confirm the destination phone numbers/emails for notifications with the user.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P1: Implement Gmail SMTP for Email Confirmation**: The current  integration is a production blocker as it only sends emails to the developer. The agent must guide the user to generate a Google App Password to switch to Gmail SMTP for sending booking confirmations to customers.
    - **P2: Full Site Translation Audit**: The user reported that some sections are still not translated. A full audit of all components is required to ensure every user-facing string is internationalized using the  function.

    Future Tasks:
    - **Add Full Language Content**: Add complete translations for Portuguese, German, and French to .
    - **Domain & Analytics Finalization**: Post-deployment, assist the user with connecting their custom domain and setting up Google Analytics as per the guide in .

**Completed work in this session**
- **UGC Form Finalization**: Integrated the Terms & Conditions link, simplified the checkboxes to two, and changed the Instagram/TikTok inputs to accept usernames instead of full URLs.
- **Extensive UI/UX Redesign**:
    - ** Page**: Implemented a complete visual overhaul, including a new hero image, a sophisticated black/nude/gold color scheme, a redesigned navbar, larger logos, and a more compact and elegant layout across all sections.
    - ** (Main Landing) Page**: Redesigned the entry page with a large central isologo, an architectural background image, and translucent link boxes.
    - **Global Style Unification**: Applied a consistent compact and sophisticated design by reducing spacing, adding background images with overlays to multiple sections, and unifying background colors. Corrected all titles to use sentence case instead of title case.
- **Functional Updates**:
    - **WhatsApp Routing**: Corrected all WhatsApp links to direct to the appropriate number: studio inquiries to the commercial number () and brand/UGC inquiries to the marketing number ().
    - **Button Logic**: Changed the Consultar disponibilidad button to navigate to the booking page () instead of opening WhatsApp.
- **i18n & Bug Fixes**: Added missing translations for main pages, fixed an issue where language flags were not visible on desktop, and resized logos as per user request.
- **User Support**: Provided the user with detailed instructions on how to deploy the application and make future updates.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: **Email Confirmation Limitation**
     - Debug checklist: The  free tier prevents sending confirmation emails to customers. The planned fix is to migrate to Gmail SMTP.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? This is critical for a functional booking system, as customers currently do not receive booking confirmations.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Backend
     - Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent was in the middle of a larger task (building the UGC admin panel and notification system) when the user interrupted with a more immediate request (create a test UGC application). The agent needs to address the user's immediate request first, then ensure the larger, multi-step task is resumed and completed.</analysis>
